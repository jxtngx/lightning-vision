This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The intent is to learn NextJS and ReactJS well enough to recreate the Dash app shown below:

The current state is deployed on Vercel at [visionlab.vercel.app](https://visionlab.vercel.app).

## Getting Started

First build the app and then run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
